    "# Machines Manufacturing Capital Budgeting Model\n",

    "#### The Problem\n",
    "<p>You work for a new startup that is trying to manufacture phones. You are tasked with building a model which will\n",
    "help determine how many machines to invest in and how much to spend on marketing.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Each machine produces n output phones per year. Each phone sells for p phone and costs c phone in variable costs to produce. After n life years, the machine can no longer produce output, but may be scrapped for p scrap.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The machine will not be replaced, so you may end up with zero total output before your model time period ends. Equity investment is limited, so in each year you can spend cmachine to either buy a machine or buy advertisements. In the first year you must buy a machine.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Any other machine purchases must be made one after another (advertising can only begin after machine buying is done). \n",
    "Demand for your phones starts at d1. Each time you advertise, demand increases by gd%. The prevailing market interest rate is r.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "- You may limit your model to 20 years and a maximum of 5 machines if it is helpful.\n",
    "- For simplicity, assume that cmachine is paid in every year, even after all machines have shut down.\n",
    "- Ensure that you can change the inputs and the outputs change as expected.\n",
    "- For simplicity, assume that fractional phones can be sold, you do not need to round the quantity transacted.\n",

    "#### Bonus Problem\n",
    "<p>It is unrealistic to assume that price and demand are unrelated. To extend the model, we can introduce a relationship between price and demand,\n",
    " given by the following equation:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "$d_{1}$ = $d_{c}$ âˆ’ $E_{phone}$ <br>\n",
    "$E_{phone}$: Price elasticity of demand <br>\n",
    "$d_{c}$: Demand constant\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For elasticities and constants [(E = 500, d c = 900000), (E = 200, d c = 500000), (E = 100, d c = 300000)] (3 total cases), \n",
    " and taking the other model inputs in the Check your Work section, determine the optimal price for each elasticity, that is the price which maximizes the NPV.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "- $d_{1}$ is no longer an input, but an output.\n",
    "- This bonus requires optimization. (In Python, the scipy package provides optimization tools.)"
